# Dam's State

What dam is working on right now. Updated with every PR.

---

## Current focus

- Bootstrapping collaborative meta structure (this genesis)

## Recent decisions

- Adopted `meta/` at project root as collaborative meta structure
- Archived `workflows/` to `workflows.archive/`
- PRs now require Thinking section for review
- Canon/Roadmap/Reconciliation as shared truth between dam and sac

## Open questions

- How does sac want to structure their PROCESS.md? (Sac should fill in their own)
- Should we align on a shared Claude Code memory format?

## What I need from sac

- Review and agree on the CANON.md decisions
- Fill in `meta/sac/PROCESS.md` with your working style
- Update `meta/sac/STATE.md` with your current work
